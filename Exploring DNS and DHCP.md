# Project: Dynamic DNS (DDNS) for a Home Server Using Windows Server 2022 on Oracle VirtualBox
## Objective:

The goal of this project is to set up a Dynamic DNS (DDNS) service to map a dynamic public IP address to a custom domain name. This will allow me access 
to my home server remotely from anywhere on the Internet, even if the ISP frequently changes my public IP address. This will help me learn more about the fundamentals of DNS functions. This will also provide me with practical experience with DNS management and Windows Server administration.
