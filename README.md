# About Me: 
ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Sean Allen!

I am a passionate, intuitive, and motivated uprising junior at Rutgers University, where I'm pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Information Technology and Informatics. With a strong foundation in computer science from Rowan College, I've built hands-on experience in IT infrastructure, system security, and technical support. Many of my previous jobs helped develop my repertoire of soft skills, such as coordination, organization, patience, and diligence.

 My technical skills include Python, C++, JavaScript, Linux, Windows, and more, with certifications like CompTIA Security+ under my belt. I'm also working towards my CCNA certification to deepen my knowledge in networking further.

 I'm enthusiastic about Cybersecurity and Risk Management, and I'm currently spending my free time honing my skills in areas like threat analysis, incident response, and vulnerability management. In my home lab, utilized by Oracle VirtualBox, I explore tools and technologies like Kali Linux and Windows Server, constantly seeking to learn and innovate. Whether it's troubleshooting complex technical issues or collaborating on team projects, I thrive in dynamic environments and am always eager to take on new challenges.

If anyone is viewing this, come along and join me in my journey to explore and learn new things within the field of cybersecurity, networking, and cloud!
